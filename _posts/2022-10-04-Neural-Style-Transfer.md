## Introduction

Neural Style Transfer is a technique that allows us to take the content of one image and the style of another image and combine them to create a new image. This is achieved by using a pretrained convolutional neural network to extract the content and style representations of the images. The content representation of the base image is then combined with the style representation of the style image to create the output image. This is done by minimizing the content loss and style loss between the base image and the output image, and the style image and the output image respectively.

Now I go learn more about it, actually implement it then update this post. And I need to draw some illustrations, and make myself a artist.
